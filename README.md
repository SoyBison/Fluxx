# MPCS 51046 (Autumn 2019) Course Project

## Guidelines

The course project is a chance for you to practice your Python skills in a more natural setting, applying them to a problem of interest to you rather than a manufactured homework or test problem. To maximize the benefit of the project, you are allowed to select any topic of your choosing. It can be a topic relevant to your day job (if you are currently employed) or your research (if you are in a research program), or simply something that is a personal interest. However, a project for another class that is written in Python cannot be used. If you are looking for inspiration, have a look at this list of [Python project ideas](https://realpython.com/intermediate-python-project-ideas/). The requirements of the project are as follows:

- The project should demonstrate the knowledge that you have learned during the class. At a minimum, you are expected to make use of functions, classes, modules/packages, and functionality from the standard library.
- The scope of the project should be significant enough to occupy your time for several weeks, but not so large in scope that what you originally proposed is unattainable.
- You are to demonstrate good software development practices for the project. This includes use of version control (through GitHub classroom as we have done for homeworks), but also writing tests for your software and documentation. If you plan on open sourcing your project, you can take advantage of one of the many free continuous integration (CI) systems ([Travis](https://travis-ci.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/), etc.).
- Your written code should conform to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- Your code should be cross-platform (i.e., works on Windows, macOS, and Linux) unless there is an obvious reason it is tied to a single platform.

There is no specific requirement for the user interface (UI). Your project could have a command-line interface, a graphical user interface (GUI), or it may be a web application or even an embedded application running on a microcontroller. However, do consider that the UI might require non-trivial skills that we have not covered in class; for example, if you have never built a web application before, you will need to first get over a learning curve related to web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.).

If you want to create a separate repository for your project (e.g., you plan on open sourcing it and want it to be attributed to your GitHub username), you are allowed to do so, but you'll need to add the separate repository as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) on the private repository on the mpcs-python organization that will be checked by graders. Alternatively, you can move your project into a new repository after the end of the quarter.

The project is an excellent opportunity for you to build software that you can showcase as part of a portfolio when you go off to seek employment. A practical demonstrations of your knowledge and ability is worth much more than words on a resume!

### Proposal

Before you begin working on your project, you are to submit a short proposal (1 page or less) that outlines what you plan on developing for your project and, if applicable, how you imagine breaking it down into individual components (modules). If there are obvious third-party packages that will be used in your project, please identify them (it's not necessary to identify standard-library modules).

The project proposal is due on **November 8th at 11:59pm CT**. You should submit your proposal by uploading it to your private repository on GitHub. Any normal file format (Word document, Markdown, plain text, etc.) is acceptable.

### Progress / Due Date

To ensure that all the work for the project is not left until the last minute, you are required to demonstrate progress on your project by making non-trivial commits to your project repository by **November 22nd**. You are not required to have a working product, but the course staff will be checking to see that you have made a good faith effort toward beginning work and are making progress. Failure to demonstrate progress will result in an automatic loss of 20% of the points for the project.

The final version of your project must be committed and pushed to your GitHub repository by **December 8th at 11:59pm CT**.

### Presentation

Each student will give a 5 minute presentation of their project during the last class meeting on **December 12th**.

### Grading

- Proposal: 10%
